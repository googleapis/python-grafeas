class GrafeasGrpcAsyncIOTransport(GrafeasTransport):
    """gRPC AsyncIO backend transport for Grafeas.

    `Grafeas <https://grafeas.io>`__ API.

    Retrieves analysis results of Cloud components such as Docker
    container images.

    Analysis results are stored as a series of occurrences. An
    ``Occurrence`` contains information about a specific analysis
    instance on a resource. An occurrence refers to a ``Note``. A note
    contains details describing the analysis and is generally stored in
    a separate project, called a ``Provider``. Multiple occurrences can
    refer to the same note.

    For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In
    this case, there would be one note for the vulnerability and an
    occurrence for each image with the vulnerability referring to that
    note.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
